# SecureDigital Asset Exchange Protocol

## Overview
The **SecureDigital Asset Exchange Protocol** is a blockchain-based escrow system designed to facilitate secure digital asset transactions. This system ensures the protection of both buyers and sellers through multi-party verification, cryptographic security, and transaction state management.

It implements features such as transaction initiation, validation, completion, and secure data compartmentalization, ensuring safe exchanges in decentralized environments. Key functionalities include:

- **Transaction Lifecycle Management**: Secure handling of purchasing and selling transactions with multiple phases.
- **Multi-Signature Support**: High-value transactions require approval from multiple parties for enhanced security.
- **Cryptographic Verification**: A challenge-response system ensures authenticity and integrity during disputes.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects against spam attacks by enforcing transaction limits on addresses.

## Features
- **Secure Transaction Handling**: Ensures the safe exchange of funds between parties.
- **Transaction State Management**: Tracks transaction phases, including pending, fulfilled, aborted, and returned.
- **Multi-party Approval**: Supports multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions.
- **Verification System**: Provides a challenge-response mechanism for transaction validation.
- **Data Compartmentalization**: Allows the secure handling of sensitive transaction data.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects the system from spam and abuse by limiting daily transactions.

## Installation

### Requirements
- **Clarity** smart contract platform
- **Stacks Blockchain** environment (for testing and deployment)
- **Stacks CLI** for interacting with the blockchain

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/secure-digital-asset-exchange-protocol.git
   ```
2. Deploy the contract to a test environment (Stacks blockchain):
   ```bash
   stacks-cli deploy --contract-path path_to_contract.clarity
   ```
3. Test the contract using the Stacks testnet or mainnet.

## Usage

### Transaction Flow
1. **Initiate Transaction**: A buyer and seller agree on terms and initiate a transaction.
2. **Multi-Signature Setup**: If the transaction exceeds a predefined threshold, a multi-signature approval process is set up.
3. **Complete Transaction**: When all conditions are met, the transaction is completed and funds are transferred to the seller.
4. **Abort Transaction**: Either party can abort the transaction, returning funds to the buyer.

### Example Functions
- `complete-transaction`: Completes the transaction and releases the funds to the seller.
- `return-funds`: Returns funds to the buyer if the transaction is aborted.
- `setup-multi-signature-requirement`: Configures multi-party approval for high-value transactions.
- `initiate-verification-challenge`: Initiates a cryptographic challenge for dispute resolution.
